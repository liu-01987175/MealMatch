/*
Main behavior is getting the address finder working
stuff like signup and other pages can come later

also something important is that we absolutely want to limit our api calls as much as possible
unlikely we will ever reach 10k requests but its essential that we dont bypass it for any reason

most of this stuff is more of a backend problem though
